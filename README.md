# Project Name - Do or Die: Apocalypse Edition
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2022

## Theme - Time Crunch
We thought of time crunch as running out of time. In our game, you have been bitten by a zombie and need to find the cure and get out of the maze before the timer runs out. It is a time crunch to save your life. There are also clocks lying around the maze that add to your time, as well as contribute to the "time crunch" theme.

## Game Play
Traverse through a zombie-infested maze in order to find the antidote and escape. You are trying to get through the maze before the timer of 1 minute runs out. If you find the antidote, the exit opens and you are free, as long as you don't run into enemies or run out of time. 

Controls:
Space or left mouse click - shoot
A - left
D - right
W - forward
S - backward
E - pick up/throw weapons
Esc - Quit

## Impediments
The main struggle was to get the enemies, the antidote and the clocks to randomly spawn around the maze. Another problem was being able to pick up the antidote.
